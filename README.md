# My Java Exercises Repository

Welcome to my GitHub repository, where I've documented my progress and learning in Java. Here, you'll find a collection of exercises, activities, and projects that reflect my journey with the Java language.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **exercises/**
  - This directory contains a variety of practical Java exercises covering different concepts and challenges.

- **activities/**
  - Here, I've documented more extensive activities and projects that I've developed to apply the knowledge gained.

## Navigating the Repository

- Each main directory (exercises, activities) contains subdirectories or individual files for each specific exercise or activity.

- Each exercise or activity has its own README.md file, providing a description of the problem, the concepts covered, and, when applicable, instructions to run the code.

## Contributions and Feedback

Feel free to explore, clone, and even contribute to this repository. If you find errors in the code, have suggestions for improvements, or want to share your own solutions, I'd be happy to receive contributions.
